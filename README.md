I completed your submitted task in two days, taking approximately 6 to 8 hours.
If I had more time, I would definitely use Dapper for reading from the database.
I would spend more time on reading data from APIs.
I would also implement authentication using JWT in the project.
I would also Use Unit Testing for decrese risks.

The most useful part I used in this project was implementing MediatR to achieve CQRS.
Additionally, using Clean Architecture was also beneficial.

To improve performance, the main focus is on database interaction. For that part, I try to handle the Read operations using Dapper since it is faster.
Unfortunately, due to time constraints, I wasn't able to add it to this project.

The last books I read include:
ASP.NET Core in Action (Third Edition)
C# 12 in a Nutshell
Clean Architecture: A Craftsmanâ€™s Guide to Software Structure and Design by Robert C. Martin
